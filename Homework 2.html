        /* OPENING COMMENT.
         * The following code is my attempt to develop a solution to the specification provided in "Homework 1L A Pretty Strange Game". I wrote it with modularity and clarity in mind, I believe I succeeded in these efforts because I found when skimming through the
         * code that I didn't need to put many clarification comments, for either the code was too short to be considered complex, or the code was named in such aa way that simply reading it led to an intuitive idea of what it was trying to do, though perhaps I am
         * unintentionally biased because I wrote it, so I have a better internal understanding of it. Aside from these two efforts, I believe it more importantly does exactly what the specification is asking, and I asked for clarification on most things during class,
         * though I do believe there were a few spots for ambiguity, and in these cases I stated what I thought to be the case under the "assumptions" section of the paragraph comment above the function containing the ambiguity. At about 700 lines of code, I believe I
         * may have gone a bit over board with this introductory project, but I prefer to do things thoroughly when possible, and this was too good an opportunity. I hope you find that this code meets your expectations for this homework. */

        /* GLOBAL ASSUMPTIONS.
         * Any function which references the "game" variable, other than the function "resetGame", expects it to be defined as a global variable, and as a copy of "EMPTY_GAME" with varying levels of defined values.
         * A move that would put the marker off of the grid leads to the marker being put back where it was AND still triggers a touch inside the cell the marker started in (and was then put back onto). */

        /* COMMON ASSUMPTIONS.
         * I found myself writing some of the same assumptions repeatedly, so I decided to write shorthand identifiers for them and just use the identifier to reference the concept in the assumptions section.
         * #A = The function "setupGame" was already called.
         * #B = "move" is an object composed of at least "direction" and "distance" members, where "direction" contains a value belonging to the "DIRECTIONS" array and "distance" contains a value belonging to the "DISTANCES" array.
         * #C = "position" is an object composed of at least "row" and "column" members, where "row" and "column" are both whole numbers. */
